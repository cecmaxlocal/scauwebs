## Project Description

The SCAUWebs project is the official development repository for a website, likely for the South China Agricultural University (SCAU). This project centralizes all development files, from initial design concepts in `Art's Templates` to the final deployable `html` pages.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories to keep the development process clean and manageable.

```
./scauwebs/
├── Art's Templates/
├── Bin/
├── html/
├── image/
├── lib/
├── t/
├── Templates/
└── README.md
```

### Directory Explanations

| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Art's Templates/`** | Contains original design files, mockups, and art assets. This could include files from Adobe Photoshop (`.psd`), Illustrator (`.ai`), Figma, or Sketch. These are the source files for the visual design of the site. |
| **`Bin/`** | (Binary/Scripts) Holds executable files or scripts for building, deploying, or managing the project. For example, shell scripts (`.sh`) or batch files (`.bat`) for automation. |
| **`html/`** | The main directory for the website's static HTML files. These are the pages that will be served to the users. This is often the public root of the web server. |
| **`image/`** | Contains all static images used on the website, such as logos, banners, icons, and content photos (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.svg`, `.gif`). |
| **`lib/`** | (Libraries) Stores third-party libraries and frameworks. This can include JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery, Chart.js) or CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) that the project depends on. |
| **`t/`** | (Tests) A common convention for a directory containing test files. This is where automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) for the project's code would be located. |
| **`Templates/`** | Contains reusable code templates, such as HTML snippets, components, or server-side templates (e.g., `.mustache`, `.ejs` files) that are used to generate the final HTML pages. |

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You may need a local web server to properly view the HTML files. A simple one can be run with Python or Node.js.

**Using Node.js (with `live-server`):**
```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

**Using Python:**
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd scauwebs
    ```

2.  **No further installation is required** for this static project structure unless there are dependencies managed by a package manager (e.g., `package.json`).

## Usage

To view and work on the website locally:

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Start a local web server from the root of the project or inside the `html` directory.

    **Example using `live-server` (from the project root):**
    ```bash
    live-server html/
    ```

    **Example using Python (from the project root):**
    ```bash
    cd html
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address provided by your server).

## Contributing
